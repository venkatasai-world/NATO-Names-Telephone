# NATO Phonetic Alphabet Converter

This is a simple Python project that changes any word you type into the NATO Phonetic Alphabet.  
For example, if you type the word "cat", the output will be: Charlie, Alpha, Tango.

What is the NATO Phonetic Alphabet?

The NATO Phonetic Alphabet is a list of special words used to clearly say each letter.  
These words help avoid confusion when letters sound similar — for example, “B” and “D”.  

Instead of saying "B", we say "Bravo".  
Instead of saying "D", we say "Delta".  

This makes communication easier and clearer, especially on phone calls or radios.  
That’s why the NATO phonetic alphabet is used — to spell words in a way that is easy to understand.

Files Needed:

- A CSV file named "nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv"  
  It contains all letters (A to Z) with their matching NATO words.

Example:  
A = Alpha  
B = Bravo  
C = Charlie  
... and so on.

- (Optional) An image file showing the NATO alphabet for visual reference.

---

How It Works:

- The program reads the CSV file.
- It asks the user to type any word.
- It converts each letter into the matching NATO phonetic word.
- The final result is shown as a list of words.
